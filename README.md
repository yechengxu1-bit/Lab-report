# Lab-report introduction
This report shows how to structure a PolyU lab report using the hkpolyu-labreport class. It includes examples of figures, tables, equations, code listings, and citations.

# Data Collection Process
The tools used: U-blox GNSS Receiver, U-center, and RTKLIB

Work flow:

1.Connect receiver and computer

2.Select COM4

3.start recording

4.follow the route

5.stop recording

#Raw Data Analysis
Purpose: Assess the quality of the raw GNSS data before filtering or smoothing

Summary: Satellite visibility remained adequate, ranging from 14 to 26 satellites most of the time, with BeiDou providing dominant high-elevation coverage

#Results and Discussion
The SPP algorithm processed 450 epochs of GNSS data. The estimated receiver coordinates varied within the following ranges
