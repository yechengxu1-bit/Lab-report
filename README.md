# Lab-report introduction

This report shows how to structure a PolyU lab report using the hkpolyu-labreport class. It includes examples of figures, tables, equations, code listings, and citations.

# Data Collection Process

The tools used: U-blox GNSS Receiver, U-center, and RTKLIB

Work flow:

1.Connect receiver and computer

2.Select COM4

3.start recording

4.follow the route

5.stop recording

# Raw Data Analysis

Purpose: Assess the quality of the raw GNSS data before filtering or smoothing

Summary: Satellite visibility remained adequate, ranging from 14 to 26 satellites most of the time, with BeiDou providing dominant high-elevation coverage

# Results and Discussion

The multi-constellation support, particularly the dominant contribution from BeiDou satellites at high elevations, improved satellite availability and geometry (as indicated by the average PDOP of 2.04). However, these advantages could not fully mitigate the fundamental challenges posed by severe multipath and signal obstructions.
